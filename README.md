# WormGameProject
A game that I developed with my son during Easter holidays.
It works on Raspberry PI Model 3 with Debian 8 distro.
Functionality of the game is slightly different than classic Snake game on Unix.
This change was requested by my son so the game is slightly easier to play.

Also there is a cool (and crude) ray gun that helps you see if your worm is on target for its next food item or not.
F1 for help.
Uses Curses and no elaborate TERM handling, so may break on devices with different TERMCAP.
